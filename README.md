The following user/developer stories detail the major functionality for this project.

- As a user, I expect to see a list of available product categories in the store so that I can easily browse products
- As a user, I want to choose a category and see a list of all available products matching that category
- As a user, I want a clean, easy to use user interface so that I can shop the online store with confidence
- As a user, I want to choose from products in the list and add them to my shopping cart
- As a user, I want to see the products that I’ve added to my shopping cart so that
- As a user, I want to change the quantity of items I intend to purchase in my shopping cart
- As a user, I want to be able to remove an item from my shopping cart

And as developers, here are the high level development tasks that address the above end user requirements

- Create a visually appealing site using Material UI
- Use a Redux Store to manage the state of categories and items in the store
- Display a list of categories from state
- When the user selects (clicks on) a category …
  - Identify that category as selected (change of class/display)
  - Show a list of products associated with the category
